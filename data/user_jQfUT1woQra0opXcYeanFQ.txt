So.\r\n\n00:04:55.488 --> 00:05:05.920\r\nOjus Test User: I just sent you an invite.\r\n\n00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.109\r\nOjus Test User: He actually went into a waiting list. Yeah.\r\n\n00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.550\r\nOjus Test User: you cannot get hit.\r\n\n00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.599\r\nOjus Test User: Think about this.\r\n\n00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:48.479\r\nOjus Test User: Yeah. Oh, have you gotten the people to try to call you on your personal number? Yeah. So actually, I'm very glad.\r\n\n00:05:49.739 --> 00:06:05.130\r\nOjus Test User: So I do get. I do get the occasional calls actually that start happening recently, it's just been spam recently.\r\n\n00:06:11.297 --> 00:06:33.189\r\nOjus Test User: We are a hardware company. So we actually love to partner with our partners. That is the\r\n\n00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:42.259\r\nOjus Test User: because you know why? Because we want to sell them our hardware, that's our ultimate selling. Hardware is like entrance is having a little fun. Marketing\r\n\n00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.109\r\nOjus Test User: marketing player to get the real people's eyes.\r\n\n00:06:45.460 --> 00:07:03.939\r\nOjus Test User: Hardware is where we make the real big bucks. Hardware is tough. Honestly, that's why I joined is because, like it was fully verbalized company, like they assemble the hardware at the company office. Actually, I see\r\n\n00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:27.169\r\nOjus Test User: you can see them like soldering and like in the clean room. And then I never used it. I still don't use it. Yeah, exactly.\r\n\n00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:37.150\r\nOjus Test User: Wait. I'll give you a tour. Well, I will. Actually, a machine like technician will, because they actually know, like, right? Like, this is the clean room at this point, but, like I don't know what the machines do.\r\n\n00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:52.369\r\nOjus Test User: There is someone that will give you. Are you here?\r\n\n00:07:53.944 --> 00:08:11.999\r\nOjus Test User: You know what sometimes I don't. I don't we? I don't think.\r\n\n00:08:13.545 --> 00:08:23.300\r\nOjus Test User: No, but okay. I was just at the AI hardware.\r\n\n00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:45.839\r\nOjus Test User: So, for example, so I ended up just like speaking hands. In the beginning\r\n\n00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:54.839\r\nOjus Test User: I was like a motherland.\r\n\n00:08:54.860 --> 00:09:21.539\r\nOjus Test User: Oh, yeah, it's kind of sick that like the hardware companies. It's not a joke. It's like a stereotyping like the most coveted\r\n\n00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:38.370\r\nOjus Test User: middle school. They get like the kids with the highest math scores and stuff, and they start like grooming them through high school and then college, and then they get like it's the highest paid job. And I was like, I'm at the same time as these people.\r\n\n00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:44.460\r\nOjus Test User: Is that crazy like they still think I'm okay.\r\n\n00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:56.799\r\nOjus Test User: Oh, because, like incorrect, everybody wants to.\r\n\n00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:21.929\r\nOjus Test User: No like any state. Are you working on a startup? They're all. It's a very different client. That's why I'm not there right now. I don't know. There are Tvs outside today. For some reason\r\n\n00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:28.480\r\nOjus Test User: that's empty.\r\n\n00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:31.100\r\nOjus Test User: Yeah, that's the power of Hooges man.\r\n\n00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:52.639\r\nOjus Test User: He's my boss's boss. So future Boss Michael. He's in Denver.\r\n\n00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:02.269\r\nOjus Test User: They couldn't believe it\r\n\n00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:15.580\r\nOjus Test User: because I learned myself 6 months\r\n\n00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:21.020\r\nOjus Test User: is that you?\r\n\n00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:26.600\r\nOjus Test User: They're good. They were\r\n\n00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:28.780\r\nOjus Test User: people\r\n\n00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:31.270\r\nOjus Test User: tables.\r\n\n00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:36.399\r\nOjus Test User: What is that\r\n\n00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:38.690\r\nOjus Test User: support from the books out?\r\n\n00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:48.950\r\nOjus Test User: That is correct. Absolutely crazy.\r\n\n00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:54.559\r\nOjus Test User: I think there are some things going on there.\r\n\n00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:57.520\r\nOjus Test User: I mean, it's gonna affect dynamics.\r\n\n00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:06.500\r\nOjus Test User: you know. I mean population.\r\n\n00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:10.659\r\nOjus Test User: And he said what statement? He said.\r\n\n00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:18.019\r\nOjus Test User: he's out of here.\r\n\n00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:45.640\r\nOjus Test User: So so.\r\n\n00:13:55.270 --> 00:14:14.790\r\nOjus Test User: Do you believe? Chat?\r\n\n00:14:16.626 --> 00:14:31.789\r\nOjus Test User: No, no, we we worked together long back. But yeah.\r\n\n00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:52.730\r\nOjus Test User: well, you're not taking the nervous back. And what's the idea.\r\n\n00:14:54.100 --> 00:15:04.209\r\nOjus Test User: So we actually have 2 ideas. The 1st idea is all the information.\r\n\n00:15:05.536 --> 00:15:11.350\r\nOjus Test User: the secondary concept that we are working on.\r\n\n00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:15.700\r\nOjus Test User: It's a public Api.\r\n\n00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:21.039\r\nOjus Test User: If the documents, or in the accurate content\r\n\n00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:23.860\r\nOjus Test User: so difficult as opposed.\r\n\n00:15:29.069 --> 00:15:50.469\r\nOjus Test User: 2 years, I said, Music.\r\n\n00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:59.540\r\nOjus Test User: yeah, it takes a while. But if you get to the right set of people.\r\n\n01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:29.860\r\nOjus Test User: How could it be? There's so many companies building these AI agents. How hard could it be to build\r\n\n01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:31.880\r\nOjus Test User: an AI of myself?\r\n\n01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:33.990\r\nOjus Test User: I can go and talk to people.\r\n\n01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:40.390\r\nOjus Test User: and if there was audio we would be hearing something.\r\n\n01:14:41.430 --> 01:14:42.650\r\nOjus Test User: I'm gonna hurt her.\r\n\n01:14:42.820 --> 01:14:47.370\r\nOjus Test User: I'm gonna turn on my audio here. I'm gonna try my best to avoid an echo.\r\n\n01:14:53.660 --> 01:14:55.309\r\nOjus Test User: Can you put my audio?\r\n\n01:14:55.870 --> 01:14:56.900\r\nOjus Test User: Anton\r\n\n01:14:56.970 --> 01:14:58.169\r\nOjus Test User: Zoom has that?\r\n\n01:14:58.470 --> 01:15:01.270\r\nOjus Test User: I'm sure. Hunter. He wants to share his audio\r\n\n01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:13.380\r\nOjus Test User: reshare and click on share audio. You know I should know this right\r\n\n01:15:13.620 --> 01:15:16.000\r\nOjus Test User: work for zoom I work for zoom, I should know this.\r\n\n01:15:17.850 --> 01:15:24.740\r\nOjus Test User: You have to stop your sharing. Then we share mango. Tell me about zoom web hooks. It's not gonna hear us, because\r\n\n01:15:28.278 --> 01:15:30.030\r\nOjus Test User: make it or something.\r\n\n01:15:34.410 --> 01:15:35.150\r\nOjus Test User: It's done\r\n\n01:15:35.390 --> 01:15:36.160\r\nOjus Test User: present\r\n\n01:15:37.770 --> 01:15:39.400\r\nOjus Test User: technical glitches. Guys.\r\n\n01:15:42.020 --> 01:15:44.300\r\nOjus Test User: What you would have seen is\r\n\n01:15:44.370 --> 01:15:47.160\r\nOjus Test User: right, David, admitting that he is, in fact, an AI,\r\n\n01:15:47.890 --> 01:15:49.839\r\nOjus Test User: and he also tells a joke about that.\r\n\n01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:51.510\r\nOjus Test User: Since you can't hear him.\r\n\n01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:53.910\r\nOjus Test User: I'm gonna have to tell that joke for you.\r\n\n01:15:56.610 --> 01:15:57.590\r\nOjus Test User: One more try.\r\n\n01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:16.180\r\nOjus Test User: I'll just tell you the pirate jokes. It takes a pirate so long to learn the alphabet\r\n\n01:16:16.870 --> 01:16:18.539\r\nOjus Test User: we spend years at sea.\r\n\n01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:21.320\r\nOjus Test User: Mango. Tell me about my books.\r\n\n01:16:21.490 --> 01:16:26.240\r\nOjus Test User: Honestly, the AI does a much better job than I do. I wish he was available, but he is\r\n\n01:16:26.350 --> 01:16:28.250\r\nOjus Test User: not available at the moment.\r\n\n01:16:28.837 --> 01:16:37.759\r\nOjus Test User: You can see that I've got the zoom call here, and this is indeed real David. So people who voted that right, David was fake. You guys won congratulations.\r\n\n01:16:39.660 --> 01:16:41.070\r\nOjus Test User: and you can see\r\n\n01:16:41.130 --> 01:16:42.409\r\nOjus Test User: he's actually pretty\r\n\n01:16:42.620 --> 01:16:43.830\r\nOjus Test User: pretty good.\r\n\n01:16:44.020 --> 01:16:48.230\r\nOjus Test User: It's really hard to tell the difference that one looks like me. The other one also looks like me.\r\n\n01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:53.030\r\nOjus Test User: And the really fascinating thing here is this only took me about\r\n\n01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:56.850\r\nOjus Test User: an hour and a half to build. There's less than 300 lines of code.\r\n\n01:16:57.330 --> 01:16:58.790\r\nOjus Test User: And the way this works.\r\n\n01:16:59.490 --> 01:17:03.919\r\nOjus Test User: there's a few pieces involved. So we've got our zoom call.\r\n\n01:17:04.110 --> 01:17:12.240\r\nOjus Test User: and we bought a recall of an AI bot in this call that's capturing the audio and the video and the transcript and all that data.\r\n\n01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:17.490\r\nOjus Test User: And we take that data, and we feed it into a large language model\r\n\n01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:21.790\r\nOjus Test User: here pretty much at Gbt. You can use any model you can use anthropic.\r\n\n01:17:22.170 --> 01:17:29.399\r\nOjus Test User: and that's generating the conversation that's generating the response to what I'm saying. And then we feed that into, Hey, Jen.\r\n\n01:17:29.660 --> 01:17:35.729\r\nOjus Test User: hey, gen, is this really cool company? They can create an AI clone of your.\r\n\n01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:41.669\r\nOjus Test User: A very realistic video stream that really does look like you.\r\n\n01:17:42.380 --> 01:17:55.119\r\nOjus Test User: and it can flow in your voice, too. So we feed the conversation from chat you key into agent. And we get that real time audio video stream back into the recall of AI Bot, which then goes to the zoom call.\r\n\n01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:05.329\r\nOjus Test User: and we'll walk through the code really quickly. And I say really quickly, because there is not very much code at all.\r\n\n01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:09.669\r\nOjus Test User: I'm going to stop my share. And I'm going to share\r\n\n01:18:10.410 --> 01:18:11.720\r\nOjus Test User: my.\r\n\n01:18:15.350 --> 01:18:16.550\r\nOjus Test User: can you see this\r\n\n01:18:18.990 --> 01:18:21.250\r\nOjus Test User: fantastic? So\r\n\n01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:23.050\r\nOjus Test User: this is realistic. My file\r\n\n01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:25.169\r\nOjus Test User: that matters. You know.\r\n\n01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:34.330\r\nOjus Test User: What I can do is it can render any web page into a low latency video stream and get that video stream into your call.\r\n\n01:18:34.490 --> 01:18:36.170\r\nOjus Test User: And what that means for\r\n\n01:18:36.230 --> 01:18:39.259\r\nOjus Test User: you as a developer using the service stated, you can\r\n\n01:18:39.430 --> 01:18:47.699\r\nOjus Test User: really just use Javascript, and you can build these fully interactive AI avatars. Here, I have a very standard react project that uses next js.\r\n\n01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:52.750\r\nOjus Test User: and if you scroll through it, the other avatar is really just one react components.\r\n\n01:18:53.150 --> 01:18:57.249\r\nOjus Test User: So we have some ids that are coming from England\r\n\n01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:05.030\r\nOjus Test User: function to start our session. That creates a session with the agent that gets us the real time on video streams.\r\n\n01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:07.680\r\nOjus Test User: Do a stop session helper function.\r\n\n01:19:08.313 --> 01:19:17.360\r\nOjus Test User: We have a helper function to keep our meeting status synced. We want to start a call, start function. We want to stop and call stop function.\r\n\n01:19:18.460 --> 01:19:27.770\r\nOjus Test User: Interesting. Here is we have a web pockets. When you're running the web page inside the box, you can get a low latency transcript in real time.\r\n\n01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:34.050\r\nOjus Test User: So this, how the car is getting? Do you have your laptop which\r\n\n01:19:35.250 --> 01:19:37.210\r\nOjus Test User: we can send that data into\r\n\n01:19:38.170 --> 01:19:40.169\r\nOjus Test User: any other zoom here, where's finish?\r\n\n01:19:41.370 --> 01:19:42.560\r\nOjus Test User: Vanessa?\r\n\n01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:44.370\r\nOjus Test User: Finish left\r\n\n01:19:48.980 --> 01:19:49.880\r\nOjus Test User: June.\r\n\n01:19:50.910 --> 01:19:51.980\r\nOjus Test User: hey, you!\r\n\n01:19:52.820 --> 01:19:53.730\r\nOjus Test User: You'd\r\n\n01:19:53.900 --> 01:19:55.279\r\nOjus Test User: do. You have your laptop here\r\n\n01:19:57.240 --> 01:19:58.030\r\nOjus Test User: here?\r\n\n01:19:58.930 --> 01:20:00.690\r\nOjus Test User: I need you to join the meetings.\r\n\n01:20:00.790 --> 01:20:02.569\r\nOjus Test User: I'm going to make you the host of the meeting.\r\n\n01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:06.746\r\nOjus Test User: No, I\r\n\n01:20:07.460 --> 01:20:09.440\r\nOjus Test User: It's probably the next 2 min.\r\n\n01:20:16.580 --> 01:20:19.829\r\nOjus Test User: Does anyone have any questions? I'm happy to answer you.\r\n\n01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:33.240\r\nOjus Test User: So you're asking me is the real time audio and video generation. Is that actually real time? Or is there some sort of lag?\r\n\n01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:49.590\r\nOjus Test User: So there is a small amount of latency. There's a few 100 ms, but that is enough, so that it feels close to an actual human talking to you, because when you talk to you they don't have 0 latency, either. They take some time to think, and they take some time to produce a response.\r\n\n01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:53.509\r\nOjus Test User: So the latency is getting low enough that it's feeling very light, like\r\n\n01:21:03.170 --> 01:21:05.140\r\nOjus Test User: gaining the Llm.\r\n\n01:21:05.390 --> 01:21:09.060\r\nOjus Test User: Mentioned that you stand a bit. What kind of data did you feed?\r\n\n01:21:10.350 --> 01:21:21.380\r\nOjus Test User: That's a great question. So with Chat Gbt, we feed it essentially, the chat history, both what the AI agent said and what the other human participants.\r\n\n01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:29.539\r\nOjus Test User: We ask it to generate a question that generates. Okay, what's it going to say in response to all the things that people said in the past.\r\n\n01:21:32.690 --> 01:21:35.829\r\nOjus Test User: You can just yell very present distance, I\r\n\n01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:37.630\r\nOjus Test User: but\r\n\n01:21:38.420 --> 01:21:40.140\r\nOjus Test User: that do people\r\n\n01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:44.849\r\nOjus Test User: do you think it's also like, when you see something where\r\n\n01:21:45.020 --> 01:21:46.240\r\nOjus Test User: there will be like.\r\n\n01:21:46.980 --> 01:21:52.709\r\nOjus Test User: we'll get your voice and we'll get you like Facebook left. But then, instead of having to be the script. It's like.\r\n\n01:21:53.060 --> 01:22:00.699\r\nOjus Test User: I'll kind of like a 4 0 kind of like, based on whatever is said or whatever period it kind of knows what to say. Back.\r\n\n01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:30.900\r\nYoon Conner: Mango. What is web hooks?\r\n\n01:22:31.100 --> 01:22:31.790\r\nYoon Conner: But\r\n\n01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:49.360\r\nYoon Conner: do not leave this meeting.\r\n\n01:22:51.450 --> 01:22:53.110\r\nYoon Conner: Mango.

That is what joins the meeting.\r\n\n01:23:12.990 --> 01:23:17.979\r\nYoon Conner: Just give it the permission to record. That's all you have to do. If you see this board\r\n\n01:23:20.220 --> 01:23:22.371\r\nYoon Conner: mango waters web hooks.\r\n\n01:23:28.930 --> 01:23:29.750\r\nYoon Conner: One second\r\n\n01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:32.040\r\nYoon Conner: he.\r\n\n01:23:51.770 --> 01:23:53.760\r\nOjus Test User: Mango?

Basically, it listens to raw audio from zoom. But then it uses Deepgram to convert your audio into text. And then that text is fed into cerblas, and you can see how fast you're getting the responses.\r\n\n02:09:55.940 --> 02:10:13.060\r\nOjus Test User: But if we want to get the responses in the Zoom Meetings chat. I've called this bot like I've given it a name of the fruit, and once I say, the name of the fruit that bot will be invoked. And what that bot is doing right now, it's it's basically a zoom developer platform helper. Bot. So if I have questions about the Zoom developer platform\r\n\n02:10:13.070 --> 02:10:27.363\r\nOjus Test User: that bot will send me a message in the zoom team chat. So a good use case of this would be like, let's say you're on a sales call, or like a technical call, and you don't know the answer to the question. You could just prompt a bot like this, and it can give you the answer.\r\n\n02:10:27.720 --> 02:10:31.459\r\nOjus Test User: within the meeting chat. So in this case I'm going to say.\r\n\n02:10:31.470 --> 02:10:35.079\r\nOjus Test User: Mango, how do I get real time notifications from Zoom.\r\n\n02:10:38.960 --> 02:10:46.170\r\nOjus Test User: I forgot to pray to the devil words, mango! How do I get real time notifications from Zoom?\r\n\n02:10:49.700 --> 02:10:52.030\r\nOjus Test User: So you probably have to say that\r\n\n02:10:52.580 --> 02:10:57.050\r\nOjus Test User: it's not detecting. I'm seeing mango mango.\r\n\n02:10:59.226 --> 02:11:07.769\r\nOjus Test User: Wait, Zoomer responded. It responded. I might have to scroll down.\r\n\n02:11:08.090 --> 02:11:09.090\r\nOjus Test User: But\r\n\n02:11:11.030 --> 02:11:13.987\r\nOjus Test User: oh, yeah, okay, audio detection in zoom.\r\n\n02:11:15.170 --> 02:11:15.920\r\nOjus Test User: Okay.\r\n\n02:11:16.910 --> 02:11:18.129\r\nOjus Test User: let's try one more time.\r\n\n02:11:20.570 --> 02:11:22.590\r\nOjus Test User: Mango. What is Api\r\n\n02:11:25.180 --> 02:11:26.260\r\nOjus Test User: not detected?\r\n\n02:11:26.770 --> 02:11:27.950\r\nOjus Test User: See it from here.\r\n\n02:11:28.520 --> 02:11:30.980\r\nOjus Test User: mango. What is Api?\r\n\n02:11:36.910 --> 02:11:44.079\r\nOjus Test User: Oh, you can see how fast.\r\n\n02:11:44.728 --> 02:11:47.121\r\nOjus Test User: Okay, let's ask another question.\r\n\n02:11:48.280 --> 02:11:49.989\r\nOjus Test User: mango. What is web hooks?\r\n\n02:11:53.810 --> 02:11:54.770\r\nOjus Test User: Oh, God!\r\n\n02:11:54.950 --> 02:11:57.269\r\nOjus Test User: This is the keyword magic.\r\n\n02:11:57.340 --> 02:11:59.920\r\nOjus Test User: No, it's mango. It says, what?\r\n\n02:12:00.060 --> 02:12:04.480\r\nOjus Test User: So did you change it?\r\n\n02:12:11.880 --> 02:12:17.213\r\nOjus Test User: Anyways, you guys get the idea, if like, I believe if there was like not a lot of\r\n\n02:12:17.750 --> 02:12:34.769\r\nOjus Test User: like if this was like, I was directly in the meeting, and I was giving it prompts, it would probably answer it. But the whole purpose of showing this was like, Hey using cerebras. This is how you could probably build like a conversational bot within your Zoom Meetings. And again, if you guys have questions, if you guys want to build bots like that\r\n\n02:12:34.780 --> 02:12:39.579\r\nOjus Test User: is reach out to us. We'd love to hear what you guys are building and help you build on top of Zoom.\r\n\n02:12:40.340 --> 02:12:43.410\r\nOjus Test User: And for last but not the least.\r\n\n02:12:43.770 --> 02:12:46.619\r\nOjus Test User: our next speaker is Frank.\r\n\n02:12:46.690 --> 02:12:49.109\r\nOjus Test User: the head of AI.

But what I'm demoing, this is. Did it show you the standard consent? I I missed that.\r\n\n00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:58.480\r\nOjus Test User: No, no, I gave it manual permissions to record, did not have time to like where it request the permission. And then, you know. So I'm manually getting the permissions. But it's listening to all my conversation. It's keep. It's also gonna pass the Nlm, the last 5 con conversations as a context. But basically, it's a\r\n\n00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:08.260\r\nOjus Test User: zoom developer support board. So for example, let's say, I'm in a call with you. You ask me a question like, what are web hooks? And I don't know what are web hooks, so I'd be like, buddy. What are web hooks?\r\n\n00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.660\r\nOjus Test User: It doesn't recognize my accent. No, what? What's the trigger phrase? It's looking, Buddy. What are web hooks, Buddy?\r\n\n00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.720\r\nOjus Test User: And then what it'll do is\r\n\n00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.490\r\nOjus Test User: Zoomer works. That's unique.\r\n\n00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.492\r\nOjus Test User: I mean, yeah, I can. I can change that word Buddy sounds like, but if but if yeah,\r\n\n00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.330\r\nOjus Test User: friend.\r\n\n00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.940\r\nOjus Test User: can it do custom, vocabulary or no, like once you use Zoomie.\r\n\n00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.670\r\nOjus Test User: Zoomie, let's see. See, I need to see what it\r\n\n00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.870\r\nOjus Test User: translate, Zoomie.\r\n\n00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:55.429\r\nOjus Test User: it doesn't recognize that. That's the problem. Yeah, what's the simple word.\r\n\n00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:13.940\r\nOjus Test User: Zoomer, hey? Zoom? No. I I checked like 2 words again, it confuses us.\r\n\n00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.200\r\nOjus Test User: Rover\r\n\n00:02:18.145 --> 00:02:38.460\r\nOjus Test User: apple mango. Yeah. Okay. But then, basically, I'm trying to show this like you can bring this in your sales call. If you don't know an answer, you can just like\r\n\n00:02:41.760 --> 00:03:03.810\r\nOjus Test User: the response comes back as a chat.\r\n\n00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:17.809\r\nOjus Test User: Technically, yeah, I'm remote. I live in Fresno. Very well. You you live in Fresno.\r\n\n00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.480\r\nOjus Test User: but I came out here once in a while. I like to be in a different\r\n\n00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:47.470\r\nOjus Test User: yeah, exactly. No, because you know what you know. Why.\r\n\n00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:58.270\r\nOjus Test User: this is like 4, 464, 70, I think 300\r\n\n00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:21.390\r\nOjus Test User: and last time, I think in the end it was 411, but then we had 60 70 registrants in the last one. Just let me know whenever you go.\r\n\n00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:22.350\r\nOjus Test User: Yeah.\r\n\n00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.249\r\nOjus Test User: they'll be in front of him.\r\n\n00:04:25.415 --> 00:04:25.970\r\nOjus Test User: Wait.\r\n\n00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:36.879\r\nOjus Test User: Yeah. So basically, it's like a meeting. The whole Zoom Meeting\r\n\n00:04:37.968 --> 00:04:41.320\r\nOjus Test User: when I click new\r\n\n00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:56.469\r\nOjus Test User: have to click, save, and for some reason no, it makes sense like the design was like.\r\n\n00:04:57.354 --> 00:05:20.350\r\nOjus Test User: But then, just passing the audio back into the Zoom Meeting, you know. So so you can, you know, you can actually change the query into.\r\n\n00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:21.520\r\nOjus Test User: Okay.\r\n\n00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:32.500\r\nOjus Test User: back into the sorry. How do you go back? I'm glad you got a 200. Okay, that's the hardest part. So yes, yeah, cool.\r\n\n00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:38.899\r\nOjus Test User: It's enough for now to get the.\r\n\n00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.390\r\nOjus Test User: But you can still put audio in the meeting via the\r\n\n00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.450\r\nOjus Test User: okay, we can play audio.\r\n\n00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.600\r\nOjus Test User: Sure. No. But just yesterday, like\r\n\n00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.130\r\nOjus Test User: June\r\n\n00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:58.870\r\nOjus Test User: just doing figuring that part out. Yeah. So like again, we have more Demos to show for the next one.\r\n\n00:06:00.163 --> 00:06:04.270\r\nOjus Test User: Okay, so I'll I'll go find Deborah. I'll help her out.\r\n\n00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:12.749\r\nOjus Test User: Let me know if you need any other help. Yeah, I'll be there for the tour, Ross, that I just caught up with him, he said. He'll probably\r\n\n00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.680\r\nOjus Test User: be there. It will most likely be. There is what he said.\r\n\n00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:17.829\r\nOjus Test User: He was at home.\r\n\n00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:24.899\r\nOjus Test User: Okay, sounds good. What do you think of the demo? The second demo, the the one that I showed you\r\n\n00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.350\r\nOjus Test User: right now let me go and see the responses. Oh, here!\r\n\n00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.220\r\nOjus Test User: So it also sends you as a chat message.\r\n\n00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:35.460\r\nOjus Test User: which is great.\r\n\n00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:41.190\r\nOjus Test User: But there's the meeting.\r\n\n00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.749\r\nOjus Test User: Oh, did I end the meeting?\r\n\n00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:46.310\r\nOjus Test User: Your camera is on.\r\n\n00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.639\r\nOjus Test User: Okay, yeah. So for example.\r\n\n00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.350\r\nOjus Test User: Buddy, how do I make an Api Api call to Zoom.\r\n\n00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:05.000\r\nOjus Test User: and\r\n\n00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.859\r\nOjus Test User: okay, so the problem is, it doesn't\r\n\n00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:13.241\r\nOjus Test User: recognize my accent for some reason. No, it's not your accent. I think it's\r\n\n00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.810\r\nOjus Test User: Is your input volume high enough, anyway?\r\n\n00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.679\r\nOjus Test User: Hey, dude. How's it going? I think it. Listen to me\r\n\n00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:29.869\r\nOjus Test User: be doing this today? Yeah, let me know. If you need any help, I'll I'll I'll be there in about 10.\r\n\n00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:32.650\r\nOjus Test User: Buddy, how do I get a list of all the meetings from Zoom?\r\n\n00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:42.279\r\nOjus Test User: I'll have to change the trigger word.\r\n\n00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.820\r\nOjus Test User: Buddy. What is a zoom Api.\r\n\n00:07:58.460 --> 00:07:59.429\r\nOjus Test User: Oh, not bad.\r\n\n00:08:00.628 --> 00:08:02.379\r\nOjus Test User: Let's try it again.\r\n\n00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:09.920\r\nOjus Test User: Buddy. Okay.\r\n\n00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:13.450\r\nOjus Test User: the Zoom Api is a restful Api.\r\n\n00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:21.029\r\nOjus Test User: Who knows why it's so. I I just asked a very like Broad. Give the answer. It's just like it's delayed by 10 seconds for some reason. Yeah.\r\n\n00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:23.340\r\nOjus Test User: it's pretty good. I mean, it doesn't have to be\r\n\n00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:26.150\r\nOjus Test User: low latency part. Let's try. Now.\r\n\n00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:32.280\r\nOjus Test User: Buddy, tell me about the meeting. SDK,\r\n\n00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:44.409\r\nOjus Test User: Buddy, tell me about the Zoom Meeting. SDK,\r\n\n00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:56.940\r\nOjus Test User: there is a good latency cause. There is a good latency. And it's also\r\n\n00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:00.559\r\nOjus Test User: because it's listening to everything. Yeah, right?\r\n\n00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:03.170\r\nOjus Test User: Yeah.\r\n\n00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:07.991\r\nOjus Test User: So what happens is again, like\r\n\n00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:18.179\r\nOjus Test User: Epgram and everything they accept like in a certain format, and we give it in like the Ps Plm. Some other format. So I have to also convert that, and then send them with\r\n\n00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:21.789\r\nOjus Test User: what if you just had a simple Ui action, kind of like\r\n\n00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:23.870\r\nOjus Test User: siri, or like literally.\r\n\n00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:27.010\r\nOjus Test User: when you press the button.\r\n\n00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:35.860\r\nOjus Test User: So that is what it's doing. But then again, in order for deep ground to realize what the keyboard is, I have to 1st take the input from Zoom.\r\n\n00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:38.520\r\nOjus Test User: have a have a button that you\r\n\n00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:39.990\r\nOjus Test User: press to talk.\r\n\n00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:41.740\r\nOjus Test User: to unmute the\r\n\n00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:46.009\r\nOjus Test User: so like, whenever I want\r\n\n00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.739\r\nOjus Test User: to ask a question, just unmute the board.\r\n\n00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:50.270\r\nOjus Test User: Doc\r\n\n00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:56.330\r\nOjus Test User: manual. And but so manual. So nobody else. Like, yeah, just like the Ui button.\r\n\n00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.689\r\nOjus Test User: No, but it's still listening.\r\n\n00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:02.150\r\nOjus Test User: It's only listening when the button\r\n\n00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:04.760\r\nOjus Test User: it's like a gate, or it's like a\r\n\n00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:11.769\r\nOjus Test User: basically. Like no cause. I'm muting the board so it cannot speak back, but it's still listening. No, what I mean is muting your audio.\r\n\n00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.150\r\nOjus Test User: but then it's still listening from the meeting\r\n\n00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:20.849\r\nOjus Test User: cause someone is talking. Yeah. So then maybe you should\r\n\n00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:24.370\r\nOjus Test User: mute all the audio that goes and we are muted.\r\n\n00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:26.240\r\nOjus Test User: meaning\r\n\n00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:28.569\r\nOjus Test User: just block all the\r\n\n00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:34.589\r\nOjus Test User: within the story I'm trying to tell is like, let's say you're in a call. Somebody's talking so like, how do I?\r\n\n00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:46.420\r\nOjus Test User: And that's why I think I think it also gives a little bit of a sense of privacy, because if it's listening to everything, people, even though it's keyboard fails, trigger.\r\n\n00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:49.559\r\nOjus Test User: people don't really believe that.\r\n\n00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:52.990\r\nOjus Test User: Feel like it was was fired.\r\n\n00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:54.480\r\nOjus Test User: It's Pmb\r\n\n00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.710\r\nOjus Test User: instead of\r\n\n00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.389\r\nOjus Test User: you. It's only activated when you click a button.\r\n\n00:10:58.540 --> 00:10:59.530\r\nOjus Test User: people feel\r\n\n00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:02.710\r\nOjus Test User: you can frame it back.\r\n\n00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:04.299\r\nOjus Test User: That is a zoom app.\r\n\n00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:09.243\r\nOjus Test User: Yeah, I mean, it'll have a that's that's fine.\r\n\n00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:11.620\r\nOjus Test User: Yeah. Sounds good.\r\n\n00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:16.449\r\nOjus Test User: What? Was the response again. Okay, let's see.\r\n\n00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:21.310\r\nOjus Test User: can you see first, st like I'm not sure if I'm hitting your endpoint, so can you let me see?\r\n\n00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:23.089\r\nOjus Test User: So I'm not hitting your endpoint.",

I don't know that I can hear it.\r\n\n00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:23.730\r\nMichael Harrington: Oh.\r\n\n00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.120\r\nOjus Test User: Can you hear me?\r\n\n00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.070\r\nMichael Harrington: Yes, I can hear you.\r\n\n00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:34.069\r\nOjus Test User: Alright so funnily. How we are running this port is we are running this bot through. Ssh, because\r\n\n00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:43.340\r\nOjus Test User: I had a very hard time trying to get Linux set up on my system. So and what it is doing is it's basically listening to everything that we are saying.\r\n\n00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.500\r\nOjus Test User: But then it's not responding back, so if I need to respond it back to me, I will have to say the trigger word like\r\n\n00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.649\r\nOjus Test User: Buddy. What are web hooks?\r\n\n00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.750\r\nOjus Test User: Am I sharing the screen? No, no.\r\n\n00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.860\r\nMichael Harrington: That's in chat.\r\n\n00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:06.440\r\nOjus Test User: Oh, yeah, that's a chat. And the whole point is like, you know, the other person doesn't need to know what I'm talking about.\r\n\n00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:17.809\r\nOjus Test User: and I can just see the difference now. You and I can see both the chat, because it's like sending it to the like, sending it to everyone. But then, ideally, I want to change the logic where it just sends it to the host.\r\n\n00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.679\r\nMichael Harrington: Hmm! That's cool.\r\n\n00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:27.250\r\nOjus Test User: Yeah, but yeah, you can invoke it by saying, Buddy. And then whatever question you want to ask it about zoom Developer Forum, if it's in the knowledge base. It'll answer that.\r\n\n00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.190\r\nMichael Harrington: Buddy, do you have access to live data like, could I ask you what the weather is like in Denver today?\r\n\n00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.479\r\nMichael Harrington: Oh, as a zoom developer platform expert.\r\n\n00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.339\r\nMichael Harrington: Buddy, how do I send a server to Server Api request to zoom?\r\n\n00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.830\r\nMichael Harrington: Does it respond with\r\n\n00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.860\r\nMichael Harrington: that?\r\n\n00:03:04.988 --> 00:03:09.769\r\nMichael Harrington: Name in the first? st Does it respond to that in like always.\r\n\n00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:11.700\r\nMichael Harrington: Yeah.\r\n\n00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.680\r\nOjus Test User: I will have to see what prompt I've provided that. But I don't think essentially it should do that.\r\n\n00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:22.620\r\nOjus Test User: But yeah.\r\n\n00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.800\r\nMichael Harrington: That's cool, though. So it's listening for the audio\r\n\n00:03:26.644 --> 00:03:31.089\r\nMichael Harrington: audio it's transcribing after you. It's transcribing.\r\n\n00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.089\r\nMichael Harrington: Once it hears a trigger word.\r\n\n00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.080\r\nOjus Test User: Yup!\r\n\n00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.400\r\nMichael Harrington: And what's what is this using under the hood.\r\n\n00:03:37.995 --> 00:03:53.860\r\nOjus Test User: So deepgram for speech to text. And then whatever context we have, it's sent to cerebras. And then Cerebras responds with an answer. I've given cerebras a prompt like a bunch of like 50 lines. Okay, this is about zoom. This is what zoom download platform is blah blah blah blah.\r\n\n00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.490\r\nMichael Harrington: You gotta do this, Demo man, and you gotta share it. You gotta share this demo. This is great. You gotta like, write this up and share it.\r\n\n00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.129\r\nOjus Test User: Yeah. Yeah. Oh, we will. This will be probably on Celebras blog.\r\n\n00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:05.649\r\nMichael Harrington: Oh, that's awesome!\r\n\n00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:06.980\r\nOjus Test User: Cerebras is excited.\r\n\n00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:10.580\r\nMichael Harrington: This is awesome.\r\n\n00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.670\r\nOjus Test User: Yep.\r\n\n00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:35.460\r\nOjus Test User: And I'm excited to like last night. I think I was like almost up to 2 Am. With June. And then today morning soon was up till, like almost one Am. Time like just click on this out. See? It's very easy. If I was running this on the browser, sending requests, processing and getting a response back in audio.\r\n\n00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.170\r\nOjus Test User: Very easy.\r\n\n00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.539\r\nOjus Test User: Let me see if I.\r\n\n00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.610\r\nMichael Harrington: Does this go to persistent meeting chat? Does this go to team, chat.\r\n\n00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.409\r\nOjus Test User: I want to say yes.\r\n\n00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.349\r\nOjus Test User: Oh, it does.\r\n\n00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.929\r\nOjus Test User: It does.\r\n\n00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.070\r\nMichael Harrington: Where is it? Can you send me a link.\r\n\n00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.980\r\nOjus Test User: Here.\r\n\n00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.580\r\nMichael Harrington: I'm gonna can I call Paul in.\r\n\n00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.339\r\nOjus Test User: Who sport.\r\n\n00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:00.820\r\nMichael Harrington: Paul Manyahi.\r\n\n00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:01.830\r\nOjus Test User: Oh, absolutely!\r\n\n00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.890\r\nMichael Harrington: Oh, he just joined a meeting. Damn!\r\n\n00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:05.720\r\nMichael Harrington: That's cool.\r\n\n00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.860\r\nMichael Harrington: We could send them the recording then.\r\n\n00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.349\r\nMichael Harrington: if there is any.\r\n\n00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.090\r\nOjus Test User: I don't know. I I mean, there would be a recording. But yeah, I mean, this is what we're doing.\r\n\n00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.579\r\nOjus Test User: So I'm excited about this today. Hopefully, it doesn't crap out during the\r\n\n00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:27.001\r\nOjus Test User: during the the meet up. But if it does, I'll just explain. I'll try to explain what it does in the code. Let's see.\r\n\n00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.060\r\nMichael Harrington: No, that's good.\r\n\n00:05:29.723 --> 00:05:33.130\r\nMichael Harrington: Why did you have to use a test user? Because we couldn't get the\r\n\n00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.580\r\nMichael Harrington: you couldn't. You had to.\r\n\n00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.250\r\nMichael Harrington: you had to work on something else.\r\n\n00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:47.193\r\nOjus Test User: No test user because it cannot. This is a bot that attends the Zoom Meetings, and it cannot attend.\r\n\n00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.020\r\nMichael Harrington: Zoom Meetings like the zoom us, sir, that's what I was asking.\r\n\n00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.950\r\nMichael Harrington: Yeah.\r\n\n00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.090\r\nOjus Test User: Yes.\r\n\n00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.150\r\nMichael Harrington: So let's see, what do I want to say.\r\n\n00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.680\r\nMichael Harrington: Buddy? How do I get past meeting participants.\r\n\n00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.799\r\nOjus Test User: Wait. Is it still on?\r\n\n00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:20.950\r\nOjus Test User: Is it still there.\r\n\n00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:23.749\r\nMichael Harrington: Still in the meeting. It's still recording.\r\n\n00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:24.570\r\nOjus Test User: Yep.\r\n\n00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.559\r\nOjus Test User: So you have to understand. I've given it a very little knowledge base\r\n\n00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:31.570\r\nOjus Test User: as of right now. But then\r\n\n00:06:32.561 --> 00:06:39.390\r\nOjus Test User: I I think it's also using the knowledge base from cerebras. And I think the message that it's sending\r\n\n00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.810\r\nOjus Test User: yeah\r\n\n00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.800\r\nOjus Test User: is limited to 50 characters.\r\n\n00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.010\r\nOjus Test User: 50 words or 50 characters, something like that.\r\n\n00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:04.410\r\nOjus Test User: Yep, but I think it responded back.\r\n\n00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:05.630\r\nMichael Harrington: No?\r\n\n00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:06.810\r\nMichael Harrington: Oh, yeah. Did\r\n\n00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:09.170\r\nMichael Harrington: cool.\r\n\n00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.269\r\nMichael Harrington: This is awesome, dude. Are you set it for tonight?\r\n\n00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.659\r\nOjus Test User: Yes, I am.\r\n\n00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:23.520\r\nOjus Test User: yeah.\r\n\n00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:27.930\r\nOjus Test User: yes. So there's going to be. Postman is going to start. They're going to talk about testing.\r\n\n00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.999\r\nOjus Test User: Then. It's going to be recalled. They're going to show something.\r\n\n00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.700\r\nOjus Test User: I'm sure. Recalls. Demo is going to be much better than this.\r\n\n00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:37.580\r\nMichael Harrington: This will be great.\r\n\n00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:55.030\r\nOjus Test User: But then I mean honestly, if I was using recall, it would have made my life much easier. But then we had to show like, Hey, we are directly integrating with like directly passing the audio to Deepgram, and then interacting with cerebras directly. And we can replace let's say Deepgram, with\r\n\n00:07:55.070 --> 00:08:02.789\r\nOjus Test User: some other speech to text recognition. Tomorrow we could replace Celebras with some other Llm. Tomorrow, so that all is possible.\r\n\n00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:03.960\r\nMichael Harrington: Yeah.\r\n\n00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:05.980\r\nMichael Harrington: Nice dude.\r\n\n00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.380\r\nMichael Harrington: This is awesome. Mojis.\r\n\n00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:12.820\r\nOjus Test User: Thanks, Michael Michael. I have a lot of you know, like\r\n\n00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:22.149\r\nOjus Test User: I have open things, but I don't think I'm in a mindset to ask a lot of those questions, so, if I may, can I set up a follow up with you? Maybe tomorrow Monday.\r\n\n00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:33.539\r\nMichael Harrington: Absolutely. I just want to let you know that Tim and I are meeting with Janet, our Hr. Rep. And we're one of the things that we're talking today is the visa issue or the the card issue.\r\n\n00:08:33.579 --> 00:08:38.299\r\nOjus Test User: And I appreciate that. But if it's going to put me in someone's radar, I took.\r\n\n00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:44.934\r\nMichael Harrington: No, no, no, no, no, no, just it's not a radar. No. Do you want? I mean, do. Okay. If you want to cancel the recording?\r\n\n00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.359\r\nOjus Test User: I mean, that's my personal meeting.\r\n\n00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:49.079\r\nOjus Test User: Yeah.

Yeah.\r\n\n00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:43.850\r\nOjus Test User: okay, images. Yeah, delete that.\r\n\n00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:49.379\r\nOjus Test User: Yeah. See, I'm not able to delete it. Well, don't delete all of it. Go to images.\r\n\n00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:53.100\r\nOjus Test User: Just click the meeting. SDK, headless one.\r\n\n00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:55.419\r\nOjus Test User: I'm not really concerned with the other ones.\r\n\n00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:59.729\r\nOjus Test User: Okay, it's yeah, there's a container using us to go to containers.\r\n\n00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.940\r\nOjus Test User: And what? Okay? There we go.\r\n\n00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:05.230\r\nOjus Test User: That delete.\r\n\n00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:06.790\r\nOjus Test User: Yeah.\r\n\n00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:08.880\r\nOjus Test User: And images.\r\n\n00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.229\r\nOjus Test User: They can select all of them if you want.\r\n\n00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.030\r\nOjus Test User: But okay, beautiful.\r\n\n00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.840\r\nOjus Test User: And\r\n\n00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:22.349\r\nOjus Test User: okay. So it looks like nothing has changed. Will you delete your build folder for me?\r\n\n00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:25.270\r\nOjus Test User: This one?\r\n\n00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:28.979\r\nOjus Test User: Yeah, yeah, it looks like that was something happened with it.\r\n\n00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.600\r\nOjus Test User: Okay.\r\n\n00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:34.809\r\nOjus Test User: cool. And then just do, Docker compose off\r\n\n00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.149\r\nOjus Test User: and hopefully, they should use the cash and go quickly.\r\n\n00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:41.210\r\nOjus Test User: Beautiful.\r\n\n00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:47.509\r\nOjus Test User: So yeah, something happened with the build folder.\r\n\n00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:02.060\r\nOjus Test User: Oh, this was quick.\r\n\n00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:06.829\r\nOjus Test User: Yeah, quick ones. It's like.\r\n\n00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.220\r\nOjus Test User: once it goes through the process once and it can use the cash.\r\n\n00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:16.179\r\nOjus Test User: It's it goes pretty quickly, but it also like it just has to do this little install bit right now\r\n\n00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.620\r\nOjus Test User: and then.\r\n\n00:09:18.227 --> 00:09:21.839\r\nOjus Test User: It won't have to do this again when you do, doctor, compose up\r\n\n00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:26.629\r\nOjus Test User: sweets configuring the build. Now this is like the piece that was missing.\r\n\n00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:30.469\r\nOjus Test User: It's doing it right now. Build file.\r\n\n00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:34.190\r\nOjus Test User: No such file\r\n\n00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:36.800\r\nOjus Test User: directory package that Json\r\n\n00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.640\r\nOjus Test User: wait. Why is there a\r\n\n00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:44.250\r\nOjus Test User: okay? It's still going. That's weird. Why does it look for how to run, node?\r\n\n00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:45.570\r\nOjus Test User: But\r\n\n00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:46.810\r\nOjus Test User: what\r\n\n00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:52.760\r\nOjus Test User: so weird\r\n\n00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:57.860\r\nOjus Test User: connecting to the meeting requesting recording privileges.\r\n\n00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.050\r\nOjus Test User: And here you are.\r\n\n00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:02.990\r\nOjus Test User: Okay.\r\n\n00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.400\r\nOjus Test User: Cool.\r\n\n00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:08.890\r\nOjus Test User: Now, what happens? It's just listening. It's just a bot in the meeting.\r\n\n00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:11.259\r\nOjus Test User: You're just writing us to a file.\r\n\n00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:18.600\r\nOjus Test User: Okay? Now, okay, if you on your mic in the meeting, then you can hear the file, which is kind of like the flow I was showing you.\r\n\n00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:22.370\r\nOjus Test User: If you\r\n\n00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:27.370\r\nOjus Test User: if you do transcribe equals through\r\n\n00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.610\r\nOjus Test User: you, look at my screen. Yeah, I'm not on my screen.\r\n\n00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:32.640\r\nOjus Test User: then\r\n\n00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:36.030\r\nOjus Test User: it'll start riding out over a socket.\r\n\n00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:41.150\r\nOjus Test User: And so let's see.\r\n\n00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.590\r\nOjus Test User: what am I doing.\r\n\n00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.440\r\nOjus Test User: Audio Rod delegate? Here we go.\r\n\n00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:55.669\r\nOjus Test User: So like, yeah, if transcribe is true. Then it starts writing out everything over the unix domain socket.\r\n\n00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.310\r\nOjus Test User: For this current version. I took the client out because it was just too much to like\r\n\n00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:03.430\r\nOjus Test User: integrate into the main branch and try to keep track of\r\n\n00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:05.130\r\nOjus Test User: Yada. Yadda. Yadda.\r\n\n00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:07.430\r\nOjus Test User: so\r\n\n00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.659\r\nOjus Test User: wow! Sorry I was looking at the stargazers for this.\r\n\n00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:14.309\r\nOjus Test User: So this branch does have the client.\r\n\n00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:28.540\r\nOjus Test User: And basically like, it's just this zoom app right here, which is like a certain version of the basic sample. And if you go into the server, there's a consumer and a trans transcribe. Js, okay?\r\n\n00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:38.550\r\nOjus Test User: And so yeah. So this consumer will show you how you can like consume the data from the socket.\r\n\n00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:42.329\r\nOjus Test User: and then with Nodejs. And this and the\r\n\n00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:46.460\r\nOjus Test User: from what I understand, the container should be set up. But\r\n\n00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.330\r\nOjus Test User: okay, and then this is a Javascript that you would need to like.\r\n\n00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:54.929\r\nOjus Test User: Enable the to send it all to Assembly AI for transcription.\r\n\n00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.680\r\nOjus Test User: let's see.\r\n\n00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:01.320\r\nOjus Test User: And\r\n\n00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:09.069\r\nOjus Test User: so like that, like, I said, like that version doesn't have it as an older commit of a different branch\r\n\n00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:11.230\r\nOjus Test User: that has like this client.\r\n\n00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:12.320\r\nOjus Test User: But\r\n\n00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:17.310\r\nOjus Test User: You'll see like the entry is also a little bit different. Because\r\n\n00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:22.929\r\nOjus Test User: right here, if you look at run, I'm I'm using like the built in\r\n\n00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:29.639\r\nOjus Test User: multi-threading capabilities of bash to like start both Npm and\r\n\n00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:30.880\r\nOjus Test User: the\r\n\n00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:34.499\r\nOjus Test User: the SDK at the same time. So\r\n\n00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:37.130\r\nOjus Test User: there's like a lot of complexity in here that I couldn't\r\n\n00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:38.790\r\nOjus Test User: add to the main\r\n\n00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:43.519\r\nOjus Test User: repo so I just had it send out over the socket.\r\n\n00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:44.919\r\nOjus Test User: But if you\r\n\n00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:48.499\r\nOjus Test User: look at what's in this like client folder\r\n\n00:12:51.702 --> 00:12:56.687\r\nOjus Test User: then it should help to like. Kind of see, I can set this all up\r\n\n00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:01.449\r\nOjus Test User: like. You see, this dot env dot sample for the client.\r\n\n00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:05.760\r\nOjus Test User: This is where you add, like assembly AI or anthropic keys?\r\n\n00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:12.400\r\nOjus Test User: This is also set up. Wait where? Where is this? This? Zoom Meeting? SDK, is this a different repo.\r\n\n00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:16.369\r\nOjus Test User: This is a this is a different\r\n\n00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:18.080\r\nOjus Test User: like an older\r\n\n00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:21.850\r\nOjus Test User: commit to a different branch. So\r\n\n00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:23.600\r\nOjus Test User: I\r\n\n00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:30.809\r\nOjus Test User: if you go back here, you can see like here instead instead of it saying main, it says, like d. 1, 9 f. 1 DC.\r\n\n00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.630\r\nOjus Test User: See that if if that makes sense, so you have to go\r\n\n00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:39.799\r\nOjus Test User: branch, and then you have to go one. Commit back. But I'll just send you this\r\n\n00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:44.580\r\nOjus Test User: just in this URL. There you go.\r\n\n00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:49.789\r\nOjus Test User: so let me show you what I have so far.\r\n\n00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.150\r\nOjus Test User: Okay.\r\n\n00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:26.040\r\nOjus Test User: hey? There!\r\n\n00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:28.900\r\nOjus Test User: Hi!\r\n\n00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:31.849\r\nOjus Test User: What the heck\r\n\n00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.440\r\nOjus Test User: you might is your mic in use? By zoom.\r\n\n00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:37.830\r\nOjus Test User: I don't know.\r\n\n00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:40.869\r\nOjus Test User: Oh, oh, there we go.\r\n\n00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.789\r\nOjus Test User: hey? Oh, well, it's hearing me over the speaker. At least.\r\n\n00:14:55.370 --> 00:15:00.590\r\nOjus Test User: so the whole point is, basically you can interrupt it while you're talking.\r\n\n00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:03.110\r\nOjus Test User: and it will take the latest instance.\r\n\n00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:15.120\r\nOjus Test User: Okay, okay, so yeah, anyways, I'll all I have to do is like, figure out some prompts here and there. But it's working. So all I have to do is now bring that into the meetings. And that's it.\r\n\n00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:27.210\r\nOjus Test User: Great. Yeah. And then just hook up to like the transcription. And that's beautiful. Yeah. So in terms of just bring that in the meeting you really just need like Csp headers and OS headers.\r\n\n00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:28.559\r\nOjus Test User: And you're good to go.\r\n\n00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:32.249\r\nOjus Test User: Okay. Csv headers and Oauth headers.\r\n\n00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:35.360\r\nOjus Test User: Yeah, let me. I actually have the link\r\n\n00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:37.730\r\nOjus Test User: hold up right now.\r\n\n00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.350\r\nOjus Test User: Copy link address.\r\n\n00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:45.569\r\nOjus Test User: Here it talks about Tovas\r\n\n00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:47.060\r\nOjus Test User: enters.\r\n\n00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.570\r\nOjus Test User: I don't know\r\n\n00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:55.060\r\nOjus Test User: doing a bind\r\n\n00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:56.510\r\nOjus Test User: and\r\n\n00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:04.099\r\nOjus Test User: wait, so this will be a zoom app now.\r\n\n00:16:06.447 --> 00:16:26.142\r\nOjus Test User: Oh, I thought you said you wanted to show in the in the client or in the meeting. I mean the same way, right? All I wanted to do is like basically get access to my meeting. I want to make it as less complicated as possible, because tomorrow it's just going to be the demo. And then, ideally, these kind of like examples would be good suited once we have\r\n\n00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:27.599\r\nOjus Test User: the\r\n\n00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:32.990\r\nOjus Test User: the real time. Rss available\r\n\n00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:35.440\r\nOjus Test User: around.\r\n\n00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:40.640\r\nOjus Test User: well.\r\n\n00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:51.220\r\nOjus Test User: I mean, yeah. You don't have to run it in zoom. If it plays the audio out over the same computer, you know. So like, if you don't care if they see the app in the meeting, and you don't need to run it as a zoom app. You can just\r\n\n00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:56.649\r\nOjus Test User: run it. How you are I don't. I don't know what the what the grand idea is to be honest. So\r\n\n00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:11.780\r\nOjus Test User: yeah. Okay. So again, it's very simple, like, you saw how it was running in the browser. All I wanted to do is like, join the Zoom Meeting via this bot, and then it'll I'll basically be able to converse with it.\r\n\n00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.500\r\nOjus Test User: Yeah, like.\r\n\n00:17:16.609 --> 00:17:17.310\r\nOjus Test User: aren't\r\n\n00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:19.439\r\nOjus Test User: if you're are you trying to send\r\n\n00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:25.709\r\nOjus Test User: audio back through zoom? Or are you just like going to play audio through your browser tab like you did?\r\n\n00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:34.499\r\nOjus Test User: That's the question. Whichever is easier for tomorrow. Put it this way. Yeah, the probably going to be easier. Okay, and that you would like\r\n\n00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:38.719\r\nOjus Test User: connect to that tab with a web socket.\r\n\n00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.530\r\nOjus Test User: And\r\n\n00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.389\r\nOjus Test User: as you received\r\n\n00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:44.433\r\nOjus Test User: the transcript, you would just\r\n\n00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:47.679\r\nOjus Test User: send it to the the front end client.\r\n\n00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:51.820\r\nOjus Test User: and then, you know, you would read it out with that voice, so\r\n\n00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:54.720\r\nOjus Test User: I would I'd probably do something like that\r\n\n00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:56.590\r\nOjus Test User: where?\r\n\n00:17:58.640 --> 00:17:59.970\r\nOjus Test User: Yeah, your\r\n\n00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:03.170\r\nOjus Test User: you can like run a node. Js, app\r\n\n00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:05.449\r\nOjus Test User: inside a docker container which that\r\n\n00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:25.110\r\nOjus Test User: that like branch I sent you will show exactly how to do, and then from there you can like host, that app that you have right there, and you can use a web socket to connect to it, so that, like as you talk in real time, it sends that data to the tab, and then the tab speaks it out loud, because otherwise what you're gonna have to do is like.\r\n\n00:18:25.845 --> 00:18:28.570\r\nOjus Test User: well, integrate with Ross, then.\r\n\n00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:32.367\r\nOjus Test User: which is part? It is built into the\r\n\n00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:37.480\r\nOjus Test User: do the example, but it's not fleshed out, really at all. So you'd have to like Raw. Send\r\n\n00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:41.959\r\nOjus Test User: the audio back into the meeting, which would be sick for like a final\r\n\n00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:45.749\r\nOjus Test User: app, but in terms of like having to get it done tomorrow.\r\n\n00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:58.180\r\nOjus Test User: which is probably like to more work than you'd want to put into it. Yeah, yeah. Tomorrow, just simple, like, you know, I'll show like, Hey, this is a board that I built. And now it's joining the meeting. I don't care in the back end if it's running in the browser or something.\r\n\n00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:00.659\r\nOjus Test User: Okay? Cool. Yeah.\r\n\n00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:06.839\r\nOjus Test User: Alright. Well, sounds good. Thanks, Max. Till what time are you working today?\r\n\n00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:10.500\r\nOjus Test User: What time I work? Am I working till, huh?\r\n\n00:19:11.411 --> 00:19:19.130\r\nOjus Test User: I'm kind of like working intermittently. I was gonna just wrapped up with lunch. I was gonna go run to the gym, I think, and then come back.
